A task tracking app built using ReactJs.

For this project, I created a task tracking app that lets users add and store tasks to a task list. Users can add text about the task, a date for when the task is due and check whether or not they want a reminder for the task.

Through this project I learned:

1. Working with React components to create a dynamic webapp.
2. Using useState() hook to dynamically add elements to display withour needing to constantly reload the page.
3. Using and passing props between differnt components. 
4. Working with forms in ReactJs.

Future enhancements/features to be added:

1. Currently working on adding either localStorage or a database to allow tasks to be persisted.
2. Adding a reminder functionality that shows you an alert when a task is due.
3. Adding a projects tab that will have their own tasklists, allowing users to group together tasks for a particular project.
4. Adding authentication to allow users to create accounts and access their data across multiple devices.
